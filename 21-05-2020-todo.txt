1) create a new user called

User: Paul
password: UFO123

and give him access to just

http://51.195.137.188/productimages/awaitingdespatch.php
http://51.195.137.188/productimages/importawaitingcsv.php
http://51.195.137.188/productimages/clickdropimport.php

2) also i need to be able to download the CSV from this table for all users, change it to show 100 records by default so it exports all.

http://51.195.137.188/productimages/clickdropimport.php

3) Change "Click and Drop Import" to "Create Click and Drop Import CSV"
on this page: http://51.195.137.188/productimages/clickdropimport.php

4) http://51.195.137.188/productimages/awaitingdespatch.php
Remove the Blue "Due to go today" statistic label

5) Remove Variation Details Search Pane from this page
http://51.195.137.188/productimages/awaitingdespatch.php
------------- DONE

6) http://51.195.137.188/productimages/awaitingdespatch.php

Show only these columns in the table:
Order_Number
Post_by_date
SKU
Image1
Setup

Rename the page H1 text from "Orders Awaiting Despatch" to "Orders Awaiting Despatch Summary"

7) Clicking any row should activate a Popup Modal that displays all the original column values in full.

From our feedback this will help the person making the product to focus.

8) Add a button on this new popup modal that says:
Add order to Click and Drop Import CSV.

When this is clicked it should
a. check the required fields are complete. (Location Bin, Setup, Quantity, Quality Sticker Applied, Custom_Name, Window Reversed, Size Check, Colour Check, Design Match) these the quality check fields.
b. if these fields on the modal can be positioned so they are in a clearly defined area for the user so they are easy to input for them.
Large fields, big buttons, clean clear interface design for the modal popup as each order will be posted from this and i don't want any mistakes at this point.

9)
Test this page is working i have attached a sample CSV to import, it didn't work for me. http://51.195.137.188/productimages/importawaitingcsv.php


10) task 10, I need CSV export buttons on these tables so i can check them.


these should be good instructions for tonights work. I'm checking the data in ALLStock and creating tomorrows work list.
